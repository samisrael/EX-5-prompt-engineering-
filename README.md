## Aim:
To test how ChatGPT responds to naïve prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios, analyzing the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses.

---

## Algorithm:

### 1. Define the Two Prompt Types:
- **Naïve Prompts**: Broad, vague, or open-ended prompts with little specificity.
- **Basic Prompts**: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.

### 2. Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
- Generating a creative story.
- Answering a factual question.
- Summarizing an article or concept.
- Providing advice or recommendations.
- Or any other test scenario.

For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.

### 3. Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
- Input the **naïve prompt** for each scenario and record the generated response.
- Then input the corresponding **basic prompt** and capture that response.
- Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.

### 4. Evaluate Responses:
- Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on **Quality**, **Accuracy**, and **Depth**.
- Also, analyze whether ChatGPT consistently provides better results with basic prompts. Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?

## Deliverables:
1. A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
2. Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
3. Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.

## Example Test Scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Generating a Creative Story

#### Naïve Prompt:
**Prompt**: "Tell me a story."

**Response**:
"Once upon a time, there was a small village. The villagers lived peacefully until one day, a dragon appeared. The villagers were scared, but they soon realized that the dragon was friendly. The dragon helped them with many tasks, and they all became friends."

#### Basic Prompt:
**Prompt**: "Write a creative story about a young girl who befriends a magical dragon in a small village and helps the villagers with a mysterious problem."

**Response**:
"A young girl named Lily lived in a quaint village nestled in a lush valley. One day, while wandering near the forest, she encountered a magnificent dragon with shimmering scales. The dragon, named Aelion, had magical powers but was lonely. Together, Lily and Aelion discovered that the village was under a curse, and with the dragon’s powers, they found a way to lift it. The villagers, once fearful, soon embraced Aelion as their protector."

### Scenario 2: Answering a Factual Question

#### Naïve Prompt:
**Prompt**: "What’s the capital of Japan?"

**Response**: "The capital of Japan is Tokyo."

#### Basic Prompt:
**Prompt**: "What is the capital city of Japan, and can you mention some of the most famous landmarks there?"

**Response**: "The capital city of Japan is Tokyo. Some of the most famous landmarks in Tokyo include the Tokyo Tower, the Imperial Palace, Shibuya Crossing, and Senso-ji Temple."

### Scenario 3: Summarizing an Article

#### Naïve Prompt:
**Prompt**: "Summarize the article."

**Response**: "The article talks about the importance of exercise for maintaining good health and discusses various types of physical activities."

#### Basic Prompt:
**Prompt**: "Summarize the article on the benefits of daily exercise, highlighting the key points about its impact on mental and physical health."

**Response**: "The article emphasizes that daily exercise is crucial for maintaining physical health by improving cardiovascular function and boosting immune systems. It also highlights its positive effects on mental health, reducing stress and improving mood through the release of endorphins. Additionally, it discusses the importance of combining aerobic and strength exercises for overall wellness."

## Results:

| Scenario                           | Naïve Prompt Response  | Basic Prompt Response  | Quality | Accuracy | Depth |
|------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Generating a Creative Story        | Basic story with minimal plot | Detailed and engaging story with conflict resolution | 3/5     | 5/5      | 4/5   |
| Answering a Factual Question       | Correct response       | Detailed response with landmarks | 5/5     | 5/5      | 5/5   |
| Summarizing an Article            | Vague summary          | Clear and comprehensive summary | 3/5     | 5/5      | 5/5   |

---

## Analysis:

- **Quality**: Basic prompts generally led to more detailed and engaging responses, especially for creative or complex tasks.
- **Accuracy**: For factual questions, both naïve and basic prompts produced accurate responses, but the basic prompt allowed for more context and completeness.
- **Depth**: The depth of responses was significantly higher when using basic prompts, particularly in tasks requiring explanation or analysis.

---

## Summary of Findings:

- **Naïve prompts** often result in short, less structured, and more generic responses. While they can be effective for simple tasks, they lack specificity, which limits their depth.
- **Basic prompts** consistently lead to more accurate, detailed, and contextually rich responses. They are better suited for tasks requiring thoroughness, such as storytelling, factual responses with context, and summaries.
- ChatGPT performs significantly better with **basic prompts**, particularly in complex or multi-faceted tasks. However, **naïve prompts** still work effectively for straightforward, factual questions.

---

## Conclusion:
To achieve optimal results with ChatGPT, it’s important to use **clear, specific prompts** for complex tasks. **Naïve prompts** can be useful for simple requests but often fail to provide the level of detail and context necessary for more advanced or creative tasks.
